So, these algorithms run faster on computers with greater processing power, for example super computers. This is where we realise the importance of the processing power of a system. Since the relevance of Moore's Law is decreasing year-by-year, we realise that rather than reducing the size of our chips further, we need to find other alternatives. There are several research works going on advanced computing areas like Quantum computing, In-memory computing, Heterogeneous computing, Neuromorphic computing, Multi core processors etc. As a part of the group, we aim to study in depth about these topics and come up with indigenous efficient solutions to the vows of computing power of systems. In order to implement our advancements and findings from our research works, we also aim to undertake development projects.\n\nOngoing Projects -\n•\tDesigned an RV32IMC processor.\n•\tCreating new designs for In-memory computation. \n•\tTesting different Hardware accelerators using Heterogeneous computing.\n\nFuture Projects -\n•\tExtending in-house RV32I for medical, robotics, security applications, with lower power.\n•\tCreating your own Arduino Riscduino \n•\tUnderstanding Hw/Sw Co-designing.\n•\tNeuromorphic computing.\n•\tAnd many more like quantum computing, DRAM security etc. \n•\tCreating our own GPU.</p> */}\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n        \n        </p><p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n        \n        This text is aligned center by adding inline css\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
