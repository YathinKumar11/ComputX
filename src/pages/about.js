      {/* <p>ComputX is a research group of IIIT Bangalore where the focus is on enhancing the capability of computing and the reliability of systems. 
There are several algorithms that are used in competitive programming whose time complexity is large. So, these algorithms run faster on computers with greater processing power, for example super computers. This is where we realise the importance of the processing power of a system. Since the relevance of Moore's Law is decreasing year-by-year, we realise that rather than reducing the size of our chips further, we need to find other alternatives. There are several research works going on advanced computing areas like Quantum computing, In-memory computing, Heterogeneous computing, Neuromorphic computing, Multi core processors etc. As a part of the group, we aim to study in depth about these topics and come up with indigenous efficient solutions to the vows of computing power of systems. In order to implement our advancements and findings from our research works, we also aim to undertake development projects.

Ongoing Projects -
•	Designed an RV32IMC processor.
•	Creating new designs for In-memory computation. 
•	Testing different Hardware accelerators using Heterogeneous computing.

Future Projects -
•	Extending in-house RV32I for medical, robotics, security applications, with lower power.
•	Creating your own Arduino Riscduino 
•	Understanding Hw/Sw Co-designing.
•	Neuromorphic computing.
•	And many more like quantum computing, DRAM security etc. 
•	Creating our own GPU.</p> */}
